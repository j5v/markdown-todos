You can style existing HTML tags rendered by Markdown preview.

You can use custom tags and attributes with CSS.

To edit faster and make list items more consistent, you can, with matching CSS:
* use short tag names like <t> for todo, <w> for WIP, and <d> for done.
* use one tag with different attributes like <t t> for todo, <t w> for WIP, and <t d> for done.

## Markup vs Markdown

Markdown source can ideally be read by humans. It's easy to customize tags and styles, to make the Markdown source hard to read. That might be fine if you're writing for yourself.
