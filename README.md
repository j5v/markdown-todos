# markdown-todos
CSS for your Atom+Markdown lists.

This CSS gives you a visual hint of the status of items in your nested todo lists.

For basic usage, place `<todo>` tags at the beginning of your item text, and progress them through yellow `wip`, then green `done` states. Feel free to make your own CSS if you have difficulty distinguishing the colors I have chosen here.

Other tags have been styled to assist with common software development tasks - see the preview below.

# You will need
- Atom editor
- markdown-preview-plus package

# How to install
Open the `.less` file, and paste it into your `styles.less` file.

Alternatively, you can paste it into an `.md` file, inside a `<style>` tag, but we recommend the `styles.less` method above.
