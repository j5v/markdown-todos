# markdown-todos
CSS for your Atom+Markdown lists

# You will need
- Atom editor
- markdown-preview-plus package

# How to install
Open the `.less` file, and paste it into your `styles.less` file.

Alternatively, you can paste it into an `.md` file, inside a `<style>` tag, but we recommend the `styles.less` method above.
